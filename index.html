            </header>
            <p>Safety glass that has been tested and labeled, such as tempered glass, is required in windows in the following locations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows that are both within 24 inches of a door in a closed position and within 60 inches of the floor.</li>
                    <li>Windows on a wall perpendicular to the plane of the door in a closed position and within a 24 inch arc of the hinged side in the direction of swing and within 60 inches of the door.</li>
                    <li> Windows in enclosures for bathtubs, showers, hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas and steam rooms where the glass is within 60 inches above the standing surface. Safety glass is not required when there is intervening wall within the 60” horizontal distance. The horizontal distance should be measured in straight line from the water’s edge.</li>
                    <li>Windows with a pane larger than nine square feet, having a bottom edge closer than 18 inches to the floor and a top edge higher than 36 inches above the floor and that are within 36 inches of a walking surface. This window must meet all 4 items to be required to be safety glazing.</li>
                    <li>Windows that are within 36 inches horizontally to stairways, landings or ramps and less than 60 inches above the walking surface or any stair tread.</li>
                    <li>Glazing adjacent to the landing at the bottom of a stairway where the glazing is less than 36 inches above the landing and within a horizontal arc less than 180 degrees from the bottom tread nosing shall be considered a hazardous location.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Replacement windows located in any of the places mentioned above must meet the safety glass
                requirements.

                <h1>Energy Conservation</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Energy conservation requirements are applied to your whole house as a package. The windows that may be used in a new house depend on how well the home is insulated. New windows list an energy conservation rating indicated by a U-factor. The lower the U-factor, the better the window is at conserving energy. </p><code>New windows installed in an addition to an existing residence shall have a U-factor of 0.30 or less. Replacement windows installed in an existing house shall have a U-factor of 0.30 or less.</code><p> Decorative or unique architectural feature windows not exceeding one percent of the heated floor area may be exempt from the energy code.

                <h1>Emergency Egress Windows</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Basements and all sleeping rooms must have at least one opening window or exterior door for escape or rescue, also referred to as egress, in case of a fire or other emergency.Emergency egress windows and doors must open directly into a public way, or to a yard or court that opens to a public way <code>Note: porch/roof covers of egress windows cannot be enclosed because they would impede an egress route directly to the yard.</code> You must be able to open the emergency egress window or door from the inside without a key, special knowledge, or any separate tool. <code>The bottom of an egress window’s clear opening cannot be higher than 44 inches above the finished floor. Alternative standards may apply to existing windows when the space is converted to finished area. See Brochure #9, www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/93019.</code> When the window is fully open, the opening must be at least 5.7 square feet in area. An open area of five square feet is allowed at egress windows at the grade floor and at basements where the bottom of the window well is not more than 44 inches below the ground. Existing sleeping room windows may remain if the room was legally permitted as a bedroom previously and if the windows meet the historical code requirements in effect at the time that the bedroom was originally permitted. <code>Information about historical code requirements can be found at www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/518138.</code> The width of the egress opening must measure at least 20 inches. The height must measure at least 24 inches. A window opening with the minimum width and the minimum height will notmeet the minimum area requirement. For example: <code>a window having a minimum width of 20 inches must be 36 inches high to provide five square feet and 41 inches high to provide 5.7 square feet. Or, a window with a minimum height of 24 inches must be 30 inches wide to provide five square feet or 34.5 inches wide to provide 5.7 square feet.</code>

                <h1>Light and Ventilation</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Any room used for sleeping, living, cooking or dining purposes must have light and ventilation. Light and ventilation requirements may be met naturally, without mechanical equipment and/or permanent artificial light, through the use of operable windows, doors or skylights. To meet the natural ventilation requirements, windows, doors and skylights must open to the outside. The total open area must measure at least 4 percent of the floor area of a room. Existing conditions may allow for reduced requirements or mechanical ventilation may be provided.

                <h1>Window Wells</h1>
            </header>
            <p>If the bottom of your window is below the adjacent ground, as in basement windows, you will need to excavate for a window well. Depending on the height, you may be able to use a pre-manufactured corrugated metal window well. Or, the window well may be constructed of materials such as concrete, concrete block or pressure treated lumber.</p><p>The window must be able to open completely inside of the window well. Inside the window well there must be a clear space in front of the window opening that is at least 36” x 36”. If the bottom of the window well is more than 44 inches below the top of the well, a permanently attached ladder or steps must be used. Steps in a window well do not need to meet the code requirements for stairs. The ladder or stairs may project 6 inches into the 36” x 36” clear space required for window wells but cannot restrict the window opening.</p><p>A ladder must have rungs that are at least 12 inches wide. Rungs must be spaced so that they are measured a maximum 18 inches from rung to rung at the same point on each rung. The ladder must be attached to the window well so that there is at least 3 inches between the wall of the window well and the ladder. The ladder must extend all the way from the bottom of the window well to the top of the well.</p><p>Any grill, cover or other obstruction over a window well, needs to be easily removable from the inside without the use of a key, tool or special knowledge. The opening size of the grill, cover or other obstruction must be at least 5.7 square feet clear.
